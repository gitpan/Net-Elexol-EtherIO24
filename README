Net-Elexol-EtherIO24

INTRODUCTION

The Ether I/O 24 manufactured by Elexol is an inexpensive and simple to
use/operate device designed for remote control or remote sensing.
It has 24 lines that are each programmable for input or output and a
variety of other things.

The control protocol is relatively simplistic and UDP based. This Perl
module attempts to abstract this protocol and add other features
along the way.

It is thread savvy and will use threads if told to. It should perform
adequately without threads, but various functionality is reduced as
a result. In particular, the module functions in a nice asynchronous
way when it can use threads. Threads supoprt requires Perl 5.8, and
this module may not function correctly, or even compile, with an older Perl.


NOTE

The author is not in any way affiliated with Elexol, the manufacturer of 
the device this Perl module is designed to operate. This module has 
been developed using only data available in the public domain.
